## 📋 Introduction

This cheat sheet contains **battle-tested AI prompts** that I use daily as a developer. No fluff—just prompts that work.

**What's inside:**
- Code review prompts
- Debugging helpers
- Documentation generators
- Refactoring templates
- Test generation prompts

All prompts work with ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot Chat, and similar tools.

## 💡 Pro Tips for Better Prompts

### 1. **Be Specific**
Bad: "Fix my code"
Good: "This Python function raises IndexError when the list is empty. How do I handle this edge case?"

### 2. **Provide Context**
- Language and version
- Framework and version
- Error messages (full stack trace)
- What you've already tried

### 3. **Set Constraints**
- Performance requirements
- Compatibility needs
- Code style preferences
- Framework limitations

### 4. **Ask for Examples**
"Show me 3 examples" is more useful than generic advice.

### 5. **Iterate**
Start broad, then narrow down:
1. "Explain this error"
2. "Show me how to fix it"
3. "Optimize this solution"
