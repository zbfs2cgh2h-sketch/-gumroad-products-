# 100 Battle-Tested AI Coding Prompts

### Stop wasting time crafting prompts from scratch. Start shipping faster.

---

## What You Get

- **100 copy-paste prompts** organized into 10 categories
- **Works with**: ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot Chat, Cursor, Windsurf, and any LLM
- **Formats included**: Markdown (.md), Plain Text (.txt), and Notion import (.csv)
- **Bonus**: Effectiveness tracking spreadsheet — measure which prompts save you the most time

## Why This Exists

I spent 6 months writing AI prompts daily as a developer. Most prompt packs out there are generic garbage — "write a function that does X" isn't a prompt, it's a wish.

These 100 prompts are the ones I actually kept. The ones that consistently produce usable output on the first or second try. Every prompt has:

- **Specific structure** that reduces AI hallucination
- **Context slots** so you plug in your actual code/scenario
- **Constraint blocks** that force the AI to stay focused
- **Output format** that gives you actionable results, not essays

## Categories

| # | Category | Prompts | Best For |
|---|----------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Code Review & Security Audit | 12 | Finding bugs before production |
| 2 | Debugging & Error Resolution | 10 | Cutting debug time in half |
| 3 | Test Generation & QA | 10 | Getting to 80%+ coverage fast |
| 4 | Documentation & Technical Writing | 10 | README, API docs, inline comments |
| 5 | Refactoring & Code Quality | 10 | Cleaning up legacy code |
| 6 | Architecture & System Design | 10 | Design decisions with trade-offs |
| 7 | Database & SQL Optimization | 10 | Queries that don't murder your DB |
| 8 | API Development & Integration | 10 | REST, GraphQL, webhook patterns |
| 9 | DevOps & CI/CD Automation | 10 | GitHub Actions, Docker, deployment |
| 10 | Career & Communication | 8 | PRs, tech specs, code explanations |

**Bonus**: Quick-Reference Card (top 20 prompts on one page)

## Who This Is For

- **Junior/Mid developers** (1-5 years) who want to level up their AI workflow
- **Senior developers** tired of writing the same review comments
- **Tech leads** who want their team to adopt AI tools properly
- **Anyone** who's tried AI coding assistants and thought "there must be a better way to ask"

## What This Is NOT

- Not a "prompt engineering" course (no theory, all practice)
- Not language-specific (works for Python, JS, Java, Go, Rust, whatever you code in)
- Not a replacement for understanding code (these make you faster, not lazier)

## 30-Day Tracking Data

I used these prompts across 4 projects. Here's the honest data:

| Metric | Before (manual) | After (with prompts) | Change |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|--------|
| Code review time | 45 min avg | 18 min avg | -60% |
| Bug resolution | 2.3 hours avg | 52 min avg | -62% |
| Test writing | 35 min/module | 12 min/module | -66% |
| Documentation | 1.5 hours/feature | 25 min/feature | -72% |
| PR descriptions | 20 min | 5 min | -75% |

**Caveat**: Your results will vary. These are my numbers from real projects, not cherry-picked benchmarks.

## Quick Start

1. Browse the category that matches your current task
2. Copy the prompt
3. Fill in the `[bracketed]` sections with your actual code/context
4. Send to your preferred AI tool
5. Iterate if needed (most prompts work in 1-2 tries)
